# Deprecation
This package is probably not needed any more given Lodash 3.0.
We are currently testing how the regular lodash package can be used in Ember CLI
But given its support for ES6 and AMD, it shouldn't be necessary to use ember-cli-lodash any longer!

ember-cli-lodash
================

Very basic wrapper for adding Lo-Dash.js to an Ember-CLI project

Usage
=====

```sh
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-lodash
ember generate ember-cli-lodash
```

see: [lodash/lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for Lo-Dash
